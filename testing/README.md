# tabspace
PROBLEM: People have lots of unorganized tabs open all the time, even when
they are unrelated to what they are supposed to be doing.

SOLUTION: A browser plugin that supports tabspaces (e.g. social, schoolwork,
etc) that separates concerns, keeps people on task, automatically opens tabs
at class time and can optionally block access to websites, preventing procrastination.

SETUP: To install the extension: 
		1) First go to chrome://extensions in Google Chrome
		2) Either drag and drop tabspace directory into the browser, or click install from local.
		3) Its installed!
